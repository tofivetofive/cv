I graduated from <strong>ITT Technical Institute</strong> with a degree in <strong>Network Systems Administration</strong>.  I have worked in the Technical industry for over 12 years. I love football, my favorite team is the <strong>Jacksonville <em>Jaguars</em></strong> , despite them not being very good. I love to walk, I walk around <strong>15-22k</strong> steps daily. I love being outside, swimming, animals, technology, sports and my family. I am learning <strong>JavaScript, html</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Jaguar Players</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Smith_(wide_receiver)">Jimmy Smith</a></u></strong> - He is, by far, the best receiver in team history, finishing his illustrious career with 862 receptions for 12,287 yards and 69 touchdowns. He was elected to the Pro Bowl five straight times from '97-'01 and had two second-team All-Pro honors. At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was seventh all time in receptions and 11th all time in yards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_McCardell">Kennan McCardell</a></u></strong> - He posted 1,100 yards or more in four of his six years, while barely missing the 900-yard mark in the other two. His career numbers are second in Jaguars history with 499 receptions, 6,393 yards and 30 touchdowns.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Taylor_(American_football)">Fred Taylor</a></strong> - Taylor finished his career with the Jaguars ranking first in yards (11,271) and second in touchdowns (62). Like so many others on this list, he was a quiet leader, never gaining the nationwide recognition he deserved, managing only one Pro Bowl appearance.</li>
